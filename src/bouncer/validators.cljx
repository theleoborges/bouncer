;; The following functions and macros support creating custom validators

(defmacro defvalidator
  "Defines a new validating function using args & body semantics as provided by \"defn\".
  docstring and opts-map are optional

  opts-map is a map of key-value pairs and may be one of:

  - `:default-message-format` used when the client of this validator doesn't
  provide a message (consider using custom message functions)

  - `:optional` whether the validation should be run only if the given key has
  a non-nil value in the map. Defaults to true.

  or any other key-value pair which will be available in the validation result
  under the `:metadata` key.

  The function will be called with the value being validated as its first argument.

  Any extra arguments will be passed along to the function in the order they were used in the
  \"validate\" call.

  e.g.:


    (defvalidator member
      [value coll]
      (some #{value} coll))

    (validate {:age 10}
      :age [[member (range 5)]])


  This means the validator `member` will be called with the arguments `10` and `(0 1 2 3 4)`,
  in that order.
